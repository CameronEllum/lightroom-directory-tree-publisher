# Lightroom Directory Tree Publisher

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stanaka/lightroom-google-photo-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stanaka/lightroom-google-photo-plugin)

This is a plug-in for Lightroom Classic that publishes to a local directory using the same directory structure as in the source images.

I use it for saving my "picks" to a directory that I then prioritize in my backups.

Use at your own risk.

## Install and Usage

1. Download a zip file from [Github Release](https://github.com/stanaka/lightroom-google-photo-plugin/releases) and uncompress it.
2. Copy the **DirectoryTreePublisher.lrplugin** folder into the Lightroom plugins folder or add this plugin from Lightroom Plug-in Manager.
3. Set up this plug-in as a Publish Service on Lightroom Publishing Manager.
