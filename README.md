# Lightroom Directory Tree Publisher

This is a plug-in for Lightroom Classic that publishes to a local directory using the same directory structure as in the source images.

I use it for saving my "picks" to a directory that I then prioritize in my backups.

Use at your own risk.

## Install and Usage

1. Download a zip file from [Github Release](https://github.com/CameronEllum/lightroom-directory-tree-publisher/releases) and uncompress it.

1. Set up this plug-in as a Publish Service on Lightroom Publishing Manager.
